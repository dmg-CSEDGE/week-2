# Here are your Challenges for Today:

In todayâ€™s club, we'll be splitting you into teams of at least 3 people. Each team will select one member to set up a Replit repository for the team's use. This representative will then invite the other team members as collaborators on the repository.

Once everyone joins the repo, our primary objective  is to update the team page (index.html) with information about your team and links to each team member's About Me page. Your About Me page should include the following:
- A link back to the team page
- At least one image
- At least one link to one of your favorite websites
- Two truths and a lie about yourself: This activity will enable us to get to know each other better.
